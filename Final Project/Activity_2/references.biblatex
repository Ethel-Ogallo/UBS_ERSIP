  abstract = {The successful application of univariate morphological operators on several domains, along with the increasing need for processing the plethora of available multivalued images, have been the main motives behind the efforts concentrated on extending the mathematical morphology framework to multivariate data. The few theoretical requirements of this extension, consisting primarily of a ranking scheme as well as extrema operators for vectorial data, have led to numerous suggestions with diverse properties. However, none of them has yet been widely accepted. Furthermore, the comparison research work in the current literature, evaluating the results obtained from these approaches, is either outdated or limited to a particular application domain. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the proposed multivariate morphological frameworks is provided. In particular, they are examined mainly with respect to their data ordering methodologies. Additionally, the results of a brief series of illustrative application oriented tests of selected vector orderings on colour and multispectral remote sensing data are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Many of the point cloud processing techniques have their origin in image processing. But mathematical morphology, despite being one of the most used image processing techniques, has not yet been clearly adapted to point clouds. The aim of this work is to design the basic operations of mathematical morphology applicable to 3D point cloud data, without the need to transform point clouds to 2D or 3D images and avoiding the associated problems of resolution loss and orientation restrictions. The object shapes in images, based on pixel values, are assumed to be the existence or absence of points, therefore, morphological dilation and erosion operations are focused on the addition and removal of points according to the structuring element. The structuring element, in turn, is defined as a point cloud with characteristics of shape, size, orientation, point density, and one reference point. The designed method has been tested on point clouds artificially generated, acquired from real case studies, and the Stanford bunny model. The results show a robust behaviour against point density variations and consistent with image processing equivalent. The proposed method is easy and fast to implement, although the selection of a correct structuring element requires previous knowledge about the problem and the input point cloud. Besides, the proposed method solves well-known point cloud processing problems such as object detection, segmentation, and gap filling.},

Such approaches have increased in popularity and been favourably compared to treating individual image elements in various domains and applications. This survey paper presents the development of hierarchical image representations over the last 20 years using the framework of component trees. We introduce two classes of component trees, partitioning and inclusion trees, and describe their general characteristics and differences. Examples of hierarchies for each of the classes are compared, with the resulting study aiming to serve as a guideline when choosing a hierarchical image representation for any application and image domain.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed images with very high spatial resolution provide a detailed representation of the surveyed scene with a geometrical resolution that at the present can be up to 30 cm (WorldView-3). A set of powerful image processing operators have been defined in the mathematical morphology framework. Among those, connected operators (e.g., attribute filters) have proven their effectiveness in processing very high resolution images. Attribute filters are based on attributes which can be efficiently implemented on tree-based image representations. In this work, we considered the definition of min, max, direct and subtractive filter rules for the computation of attribute filters over the tree of shapes representation. We study their performance on the classification of remotely sensed images. We compare the classification results over the tree of shapes with the results obtained when the same rules are applied on the component trees. The random forest is used as a baseline classifier and the experiments are conducted using multispectral data sets acquired by QuickBird and IKONOS sensors over urban areas.},

  abstract = {Morphological attribute profiles (APs) are defined as a generalization of the recently proposed morphological profiles (MPs). APs provide a multilevel characterization of an image created by the sequential application of morphological attribute filters that can be used to model different kinds of the structural information. According to the type of the attributes considered in the morphological attribute transformation, different parametric features can be modeled. The generation of APs, thanks to an efficient implementation, strongly reduces the computational load required for the computation of conventional MPs. Moreover, the characterization of the image with different attributes leads to a more complete description of the scene and to a more accurate modeling of the spatial information than with the use of conventional morphological filters based on a predefined structuring element. Here, the features extracted by the proposed operators were used for the classification of two very high resolution panchromatic images acquired by Quickbird on the city of Trento, Italy. The experimental analysis proved the usefulness of APs in modeling the spatial information present in the images. The classification maps obtained by considering different APs result in a better description of the scene (both in terms of thematic and geometric accuracy) than those obtained with an MP.},

  abstract = {The integration of mathematical morphology operations within convolutional neural network architectures has received an increasing attention lately. However, replacing standard convolution layers by morphological layers performing erosions or dilations is particularly challenging because the min and max operations are not differentiable. P-convolution layers were proposed as a possible solution to this issue since they can act as smooth differentiable approximation of min and max operations, yielding pseudo-dilation or pseudo-erosion layers. In a recent work, we proposed two novel morphological layers based on the same principle as the p-convolution, while circumventing its principal drawbacks, and showcased their capacity to efficiently learn grayscale morphological operators while raising several edge cases. In this work, we complete those previous results by thoroughly analyzing the behavior of the proposed layers and by investigating and settling the reported edge cases. We also demonstrate the compatibility of one of the proposed morphological layers with binary morphological frameworks.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is mainly used to investigate sites of dams, bridges, and pipelines to locate construction materials and provide detailed geographic information. In remote sensing image analysis, the images captured through satellite and drones are used to observe surface of the Earth. The main aim of any image classification-based system is to assign semantic labels to captured images, and consequently, using these labels, images can be arranged in a semantic order. The semantic arrangement of images is used in various domains of digital image processing and computer vision such as remote sensing, image retrieval, object recognition, image annotation, scene analysis, content-based image analysis, and video analysis. The earlier approaches for remote sensing image analysis are based on low-level and mid-level feature extraction and representation. These techniques have shown good performance by using different feature combinations and machine learning approaches. These earlier approaches have used small-scale image dataset. The recent trends for remote sensing image analysis are shifted to the use of deep learning model. Various hybrid approaches of deep learning have shown much better results than the use of a single deep learning model. In this review article, a detailed overview of the past trends is presented, based on low-level and mid-level feature representation using traditional machine learning concepts. A summary of publicly available image benchmarks for remote sensing image analysis is also presented. A detailed summary is presented at the end of each section. An overview regarding the current trends of deep learning models is presented along with a detailed comparison of various hybrid approaches based on recent trends. The performance evaluation metrics are also discussed. This review article provides a detailed knowledge related to the existing trends in remote sensing image classification and possible future research directions.},

A wide variety of morphological transformations are available for extracting structural information in spatial data. Accordingly, a stream of successful applications in geoscience and remote sensing have been reported since the mid-1980s as highlighted in a brief survey. However, recent advances in the theory of mathematical morphology still remain largely unexplored. We show in this paper that they can enhance methodologies for the processing and analysis of earth observation data for tasks as diverse as filtering, simplification, directional segmentation and crest line extraction. We also address important issues overlooked in the past and concerning the applicability of a given morphological filter to earth observation data. In particular, we point out that self-dual or even self-complementary filters are required in many applications to produce results independent of the local contrast of the searched image structures.},
